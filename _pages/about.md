** Research

Sathya Karunananthan’s research on health services focuses on improving access to care for older adults with complex health conditions, such as dementia, frailty, chronic pain and Parkinson’s disease. She investigates disparities in care access among underserved communities, specifically, linguistic minority and racialized groups. She studies the impact of health technologies like electronic consultation and artificial intelligence on inequities in access to care and health outcomes.

Professor Karunananthan’s work in meta-research examines how research is conducted, to identify potential sources of bias, raise awareness of them and advocate for practices and guidelines that minimize them, ensuring that scientific findings are both robust and reliable.

Professor Karunananthan’s  research program has been funded by a variety of sources including the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the uOttawa Brain and Mind Research Institute (uOBMRI), the Brain-Heart Interconnectome (BHI), the Consortium national de formation en santé (CNFS), Innovations Strengthening Primary Health Care Through Research (INSPIRE-PHC), the Community Health and Social Services Network (CHSSN) and the Alzheimer Society of Canada.
